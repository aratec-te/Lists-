Contributing

I want this to become a truly awesome resource. Devs should be able to take a look and choose a great resource without googling for hours.

If you have any suggestions on how to make this better, open an issue.
If you have a resource to contribute, make a pull request. Please just use add resource.com in your commit message.
Please keep the format in alphabetical order.
In vim: Select the lines to be sorted in "Visual Line" mode with Shift + V and invoke the "sort" function with :sort.
In SublimeText: Just select the lines to be sorted and hit F5.
Please make sure the provider isn't some EvilCorpâ„¢ that'll send nice letters with a hefty price tag through their attorneys later on.

ToDo

figure out which data beside the licences is interesting/important
figure out a good way to format and represent the data
